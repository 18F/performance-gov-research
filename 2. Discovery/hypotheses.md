# Broad hypotheses

These are [broad hypotheses](https://lean-product-design.18f.gov/5-develop-hypotheses/) based on the research done so far. We will continue to add and refine these hypotheses during the discovery. We may choose to test some of these broad hypotheses in interviews or prototypes.

| We believe that (doing/building/creating this) | For this user/persona | Will result in (this outcome) | We’ll know we’re right when we see (this signal / metric) |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
| Existing agency performance plans and reports from PDF to a web-based format like HTML | agency performance teams | better sharing of performance information | agencies are including permalinks to performance information in decision making and announcements |
| Existing agency performance plans and reports from PDF to a web-based format like HTML | journalists and researchers | users finding performance information using the same tools they use for finding any other kind of information, e.g. Google web search | users citing performance information |
| Existing agency performance plans and reports from PDF to a web-based format like HTML | engaged citizen | users finding performance information when looking for non-performance related (but topic related) information | users citing performance information |
| Existing agency performance plans and reports from PDF to a web-based format like HTML | agency performance teams | richer story-telling experience | performance stories that engage target users |
| Making more performance data publicly available on agency websites and cataloged in data.gov | journalists and researchers | users finding performance information valuable, instead of PR | users download, cite, and leverage this data |
| Making more performance data public available on agency websites and cataloged in data.gov | journalists and researchers | leveraging data to solve related problems or generate new insights | users download, cite, and leverage this data |
| Making any datasets easier to publish publicly and catalog on data.gov | journalists and researchers | finding performance data | users download, cite, and leverage this data |
| Educating the public on how the government does performance management | journalists and researchers | more engagement between the public and agencies | users are writing about how the government does performance |
| Providing minimal context around performance evaluation | journalists and researchers | better understanding of what/how/why metrics have been chosen for performance | users consider performance information useful |
| Reducing the amount of high-level context (CAP goals, APGs, Strategic goals, etc) | journalists and researchers | topic-specific performance information being more useful and accessible | users understand the purpose of performance.gov |
| Providing basic site search | journalists and researchers | users finding the topics they are looking for, independent of agency, theme, or artificial taxonomy | utilization of basic search, click throughs of search terms |
| Linking directly to raw datasets on data.gov | journalists and researchers | users leveraging their existing tools and practices to analyze data | users download, cite, and leverage this data |
| Providing a visual timeline for when performance information is updated | journalists and researchers | more engagement between the public and agencies | users return to performance.gov when performance information is updated |
| Providing a visual timeline for when performance information is updated | journalists and researchers | better understanding of how performance information fits into the larger picture | users are writing about how the government does performance |
