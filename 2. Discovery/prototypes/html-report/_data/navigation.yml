# This file defines the structure of various named navigational
# listings, any of which can be used (with some caveats) as the
# links in your header, footer, and per-page side navigation.
#
# For instance, if you have a "primary" navigation list here, you
# can use that as your header's primary navigation by setting
# `primary.links` to "primary":
#
# primary:
#   links: primary
