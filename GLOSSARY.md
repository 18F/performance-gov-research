# performance.gov glossary

This is an unofficial glossary of terms used internally within this project. The
purpose is to use a shared language within the project so we're all on the same
page about what different terms mean. The terms might not be using the official
or legal definition.


##### agency performance plan (APP)


##### annual performance report (APR)


##### APG

Agency Priority Goal. Target areas where agency leaders want to achieve
near-term performance improvement through focused senior leadership attention.
APGs advance progress toward longer-term, outcome-focused goals in the agency's
Strategic Plan.

Require quarterly progress updates.


##### Business intelligence

Often abbreviated BI, it is the strategies and technologies used by organizations for the data analysis of business information.


##### CAP goal

A Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) goal is a tool used to accelerate progress on a limited number of priority areas where implementation requires active collaboration between multiple agencies, overcoming organizational barriers to achieve better performance than one agency can achieve on its own.

Set or revised at least every four years, CAP Goals include outcome-oriented goals that cover a limited number of crosscutting policy areas as well as management goals focused on management improvements across the Federal Government in areas of financial management, strategic human capital management, information technology management, procurement and acquisition management, and real property management.

A series of 16 CAP Goals were announced in the 2015 Budget with clearly named accountable officials, data-driven reviews that incorporated a broad range of quantitative and qualitative inputs, and reporting to the public through a common website as a framework to drive performance improvements on cross-government collaboration and tackle government-wide management challenges affecting most agencies.
