# About this project 

Performance.gov, housed within the Office of Government-wide Policy (OGP), is a window into every federal agency's efforts to deliver a more effective, smarter and leaner government. Performance.gov showcases what the federal government is working to accomplish, how it seeks to accomplish its objectives and why these efforts are important. The site is used by the public, various agencies, members of Congress, and the media. It enables its users to monitor progress being made across administrations in improving performance and delivering results to the American people.

Since its creation in 2012, the site has acquired extensive technical debt and is extremely cumbersome to use and to support. OGP has brought our team at 18F to create a modernized performance.gov that better meets user needs and opens up data to the public.

In our approach, we will first reach out to major stakeholders, existing users and potential users of the site to understand challenges they've experienced and attempt to identify new opportunities. We will then use our research to propose a product vision and roadmap for a new and modernized Performance.gov.

# The Challenge 
Our current goal is to understand the needs and perspectives for the suppliers of performance data and understand how the data moves through the current state system to define the parameters for a useful site. Currently, the experience for agency staff to submit information on performance.gov is cumbersome and there are deep organizational barriers that prevent agencies from collecting and using performance data to help make decisions. There also isn't a clear audience for the performance information provided so the public and government users find little value in the actual data. Currently, many agencies feel that submitting performance data is just an exercise they have to do and they do not derive a lot of value from the data collected.

# Our Hypothesis
We want to tell the right story with the data that agencies provide that is most important to a variety of users inside and outside of the government.
