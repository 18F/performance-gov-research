asterisk indicates additional measures

### HUD
https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/spm 
Storytelling is minimal; most of the page is dedicated to explaining the wider program offices. There are, however, a few images that show charts of stats related to strategic objectives. [screenshot] These charts are a bit ambiguous as far as the performance metrics themselves go. They seem to be displaying latest known figures for the objectives, but do not link to or explain the strategic objectives or plans. Below the charts is a link to [HUD’s FY 2016 Annual Performance Report (APR)](https://www.hud.gov/sites/documents/2017_APP_2015_APR_FINAL.PDF) for more information.



### USDA
https://www.usda.gov/our-agency/about-usda/performance 
This page is mostly a list of PDFs, but links to a page about their strategic goals: https://www.usda.gov/our-agency/about-usda/strategic-goals
The strategic goals page lists objectives for each goal, and each objective has a short (approx 3-5 minute) video of the USDA secretary talking about what the objectives are and why they are important.

### Department of Commerce
https://www.commerce.gov/page/about-commerce 
Commerce's strategic goals are presented on their “About” page, each linked to a brief description of what that goal is. [screenshot] The bulleted linked list appears to be the strategic objectives within the goal. The links go, somewhat oddly, to a river of stories tagged with that topic. For instance, “Advance understanding of environmental change” links to a river of stories tagged “Climate Change.”

### Department of Education
Annual Performance Reports: https://www2.ed.gov/about/reports/annual/index.html?src=ln 
Agency Priority Goals: https://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/focus/goals.html 

Beyond the usual list of PDFs, the DoE has published their priority goals separately, without linking them in any way to the annual reports or strategic plans. This has the effect of letting a more casual browser find the agency’s priorities without overwhelming them with the details of an APR.

### HHS
https://www.hhs.gov/about/budget/fy2017/performance/index.html 
This is a prime example of what a PDF -> HTML report looks like.

### GSA
https://www.gsa.gov/reference/reports/budget-performance/annual-reports/2017-agency-financial-report/managements-discussion-and-analysis/performance-summary 

The page that links to the performance plans, specifically, is just a list of links, but the page that showcases the performance summary in the latest financial report is worth a look. (It also indicates that perhaps what we should be looking at is more report-level storytelling, rather than site-level storytelling.)
The performance summary is graphical, easy to scan, and written in plain language.  [screenshot]
For example, “Agency performance goals: This section provides an overview of GSA’s performance against strategic goals,” is easy to understand at face value, even without knowing what a strategic goal is in GPRA terms. [screenshot]

### NASA
https://www.nasa.gov/news/budget/index.html 
NASA does not seem to have annual performance reports or plans at all.
They do have a 1:30 minute video that provides a brief overview of what they want to accomplish in the near future.
Their strategic plan is available in PDF, and also includes a “Guide to the Strategic Plan” (also PDF; clearly meant to print and tri-fold) that seems to be a more plain-language explanation of what the plan is.

### OPM
https://www.opm.gov/about-us/budget-performance/goals-priorities and https://www.opm.gov/about-us/budget-performance/performance/ 
The actual performance reports are just a list of links, but OPM does have a helpful “goals and priorities” section that makes the strategic goals and agency priorities apparent.
