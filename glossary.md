# performance.gov glossary

This is an unofficial glossary of terms used internally within this project. The
purpose is to use a shared language within the project so we're all on the same
page about what different terms mean. The terms might not be using the official
or legal definition.


##### agency performance plan (APP)
A plan for a department or agency that provides detailed performance-related information to the President, the
Congress, and the American people. This plan allows readers to identify the agency's performance
targets for the coming fiscal year, relative to the agency's objectives and stewardship of public resources.

##### annual performance report (APR)
An agency report that provides detailed performance-related information to the President, the
Congress, and the American people. This report allows readers to assess the agency's fiscal year performance,
revisions to the goals for that same fiscal year, and plans for Agency Priority Goals (APGs) in the coming fiscal year, relative to the agency's mission and stewardship of public resources.

##### APG

Agency Priority Goal. A performance goal in target areas where agency leaders want to achieve
near-term performance improvement through focused senior leadership attention.
APGs advance progress toward longer-term, outcome-focused goals in the agency's
Strategic Plan.

##### Business intelligence

##### CAP goal

A Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) goal is a tool used to accelerate progress on a limited number of priority areas where implementation requires active collaboration between multiple agencies, overcoming organizational barriers to achieve better performance than one agency can achieve on its own.

Set or revised at least every four years, CAP Goals include outcome-oriented goals that cover a limited number of crosscutting policy areas as well as management goals focused on management improvements across the Federal Government in areas of financial management, strategic human capital management, information technology management, procurement and acquisition management, and real property management.

A series of 16 CAP Goals were announced in the 2015 Budget with clearly named accountable officials, data-driven reviews that incorporated a broad range of quantitative and qualitative inputs, and reporting to the public through a common website as a framework to drive performance improvements on cross-government collaboration and tackle government-wide management challenges affecting most agencies.


##### Chief Evaluation Officer
A proposed, new agency position by [H.R.4174 - Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2017](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4174/text). This position would be appointed by the head of each agency and will be in charge of

##### federal program inventory

A document or report (or the act of researching to create the document or report) that consolidates information about federal programs working on the same goal.

##### Resource Management Office

Resource Management Office - One of five OMB offices on the B (budget) side that helps to carry out OMB’s central activity of assisting the President in overseeing the preparation of the Federal Budget and supervising its administration of Executive Branch agencies.  In helping to formulate the President’s spending plans, the RMOs assess the effectiveness of agency programs, policies, and procedures, weigh competing funding demands within and among agencies, and help work with agencies to set funding priorities.  Once the Budget is enacted, RMOs are responsible for the execution of Federal budgetary policies and provide ongoing policy and management guidance to Federal agencies.  As part of these and other responsibilities, the RMOs provide analysis and evaluation, oversee implementation of policy options, and support government-wide management initiatives.

Resource Management Officer - Assigned to an agency by the Office of Management and Budget. Reviews the
agency's mission and overview, strategic plans, and priority goals and
indicators.


##### strategic goal

A high-level, non-measurable articulation of what an agency or department will do to reach or achieve their mission. It provides a high-level focus to the work and usually highlights an implicit theory of change. Most organizaitons will have a few different strategic goals (3-9) that they pursue to reach their mission. While the strategic goal tells what an agency or department will do to achieve a mission, it does not articulate how they will do it ([strategic objectives](#strategic-objective)) or how they will determine success[performance measures](#indicators-and-indicator-instances).

##### strategic objective

A low or mid-level, sometimes non-measurable, articulation of how an agency or department will do what they say they will do ([strategic goal](#strategic-goal)) to achieve their overall goal (mission). Organizations will usually create multiple strategic objectives (the how) for each [strategic goal](#strategic-goal) (the what).


##### strategic plan

A plan created by an organization (in this case a federal government department or agency) that provides a framework for
the delivery of the organization's mission and vision. Usually covering a number of years (like 5 years), the strategic plan outlines a set of [strategic goals](#strategic-goal), [objectives](#strategic-objective), and [performance measures](#indicators-and-indicator-instances). Simply put, a strategic plan serves as a guide for what an agency, department, or organization will achieve, how it will achieve it, and how it will measure our success. 

##### suppliers

A general term possibly referring to one of four groups depending on the context.

* the organizations who supply collected data, in other words, departments and agencies
* the performance team members who submit the data into the [PREP](#prep) system for OMB and the PIC.
* the people located in departments and agencies who collect and supply the data to the agency performance teams, in other words, program managers
* the external grantee organizations, businesses, state governments, and local governments who supply data to government program managers based on how they use federal government resources and results.
