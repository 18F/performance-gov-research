tagline: Executive <br/> Summary
intro: |
  Performance.gov provides a window into how federal agencies function and perform. The transparency and accountability site is mandated by the Government Performance and Results Act Modernization Act (GPRAMA) of 2010, is managed by Performance Improvement Council (PIC), and overseen by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

  In the fall of 2017, PIC/OMB brought on 18F to conduct user research and help develop a strategy for the future of Performance.gov. 18F conducted interviews and prototype testing sessions with a vast set of performance.gov users. From the observations made in those sessions, we identified ways to significantly improve the way users engage with performance information.

      - Provide contextual clues that can teach users about the performance framework.
      - Make performance data accessible with downloadable and well documented datasets.
      - Link performance information and graphics to their underlying data.
      - Connect to additional datasets to help researchers and journalists align multiple data sources for their work.
