## Strategic Goal: Strengthen the Nation’s Housing Market to Bolster the Economy and Protect Consumers
A robust housing market plays a large role in stabilizing our neighborhoods and
strengthening our national economy. That is why the recent upturn in the housing
market has been so crucial to the overall economic recovery. In November 2015,
housing starts were 139 percent higher than at the beginning of the administration,
and housing added one percentage point more to GDP. HUD has played a critical
role in bringing about this recovery—helping American families keep their homes
and stabilizing neighborhoods hard hit by foreclosure. The 50 basis point reduction
in the FHA Mortgage Insurance Premium has helped stimulate first-time home
buying.

HUD will work with other agencies, Congress, and stakeholder groups to build on
this success by creating a long-term sustainable housing system. In doing so, HUD
aims to minimize taxpayer risk by fostering private capital as a primary source of
liquidity and focus government participation to a more targeted market of under
served borrowers while still allowing it to maintain its countercyclical3 role. The right
solution will ensure continued access to homeownership and multifamily investment
opportunities for credit-worthy borrowers while avoiding the problem of private
gains and public losses.

In particular, HUD should use the best statistical methods for evaluating the creditworthiness
of borrowers. A well-specified scorecard should eliminate the need for
credit-overlays, and hence enable the origination of safe loans to a greater share of
underrepresented minority borrowers.

### Strategic Objective: Housing Market
#### Promote a sustainable housing finance system that provides support during market disruptions, with a properly defined role for the US government.

<strong>FY 2015 APR progress update</strong>

<p>The housing market continued to improve in FY 2015, and HUD continues to monitor borrower
composition and origination trends to ensure our target borrowers are being served. HUD initiated work
on appropriate strategies for developing enhanced credit scorecards. As always, HUD continues to engage
with stakeholders and policymakers to ensure potential housing finance reform legislation meets the
Administration’s housing policy priorities.</p>
<strong>Major Milestones</strong>
<ul>
<li>9/30/2016 Determine appropriate testing strategy for the use of alternative credit scorecards.
Credit scorecards estimate the probability a potential borrower will exhibit a behavior like
bankruptcy, default, or delinquency. Several methods are available to calculate a more
accurate scorecard, increasing the predictability of borrower activity.</li>
<li>9/30/2016 Issue guidance to lenders on statistically robust scorecards to help remove incentives
for overlays. Overlays are additional requirements by loan providers that can prevent
otherwise credit-worthy borrowers from accessing loan products.</li>
<li>9/30/2017 Expand the use of more current alternative credit metrics into scorecards.</li>
<li>9/30/2017 Remove incentives for overlays by means of statistically robust scorecards.</li>

#### Overview of this objective
HUD will continue to work with other agencies, Congress, and stakeholder groups to promote a sustainable
housing system. In doing so, HUD aims to minimize taxpayer risk by fostering private capital as a primary
source of liquidity, and focus government participation while allowing it to maintain its countercyclical
role. The right solution will ensure continued access to homeownership and multifamily investment
opportunities for creditworthy borrowers while avoiding the problem of private gains and public losses.

#### Measuring our progress
HUD will track the following performance indicators, which respond to market changes. These metrics are
tracking only, as the ideal mix of private capital in the market is unknown. The desired trend is to see an
increase in private capital.

- **Performance indicator: Overall market share of single-family new originations for private capital, Government sponsored
enterprises (GSEs), Federal Housing Administration (FHA), and Veterans Affairs (VA).** This measure tracks the share of the mortgage market for all private lenders, GSEs (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac), FHA, and VA in order to observe FHA’s role in the housing market and the balance of the housing market.

- **Performance indicator: Share of FHA mortgages to first-time home buyers.** While FHA has historically insured about 13
percent of all mortgage originations during its past 80 years, it has funded more than 50 percent
of all first-time homebuyer mortgages during this same time. This metric tracks the percentage of
annual FHA endorsements going to first-time homebuyers.
