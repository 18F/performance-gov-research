- *Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993* - requires each agency to produce a strategic plan every three years, an annual performance report each February, and annual performance report. 
- *GPRA Modernization Act of 2010* - a variety of reforms aimed at modernizing the government's nearly two-decade old performance management framework. Requires agencies to update their Strategic Plan every four years. Congress also included transparency provisions in GPRAMA, which makes OMB responsible for: 
	- Priority goals - establish a single federal website that provides updates on cross-agency and agency priority goals, including quarterly measures and milestones
	- Federal program inventory - develop a consolidated list of fed govt programs for inclusion on the site; and
	- Agency performance plans and reports - making available all agency strategic plans, annual performance plans, and annual performance reports on this website in a "searchable and machine-readable format"
- *[GAO Report](http://www.gao.gov/assets/680/679395.pdf)* Summary of findings
	- While OMB Has Enhanced Performance.gov, Further Actions Could Make It More Useful
	- OMB, GSA, and the PIC Collect Some Customer Feedback but Have Not Engaged Broader Audiences
	- OMB and GSA Conducted a Usability Test, but Key Actions Remain Unaddressed
	- OMB and the PIC Have Made Progress in Tracking Additional Performance Measures, but Have Yet to Establish Goals
	- Our Prior Reports Found Performance.gov Does Not Consistently Meet GPRAMA Requirements
	- OMB Does Not Have a Strategic Plan for the Future of Performance.gov
	- OMB and the PIC Do Not Have a Customer Outreach Strategy
	- Performance.gov Does Not Inform Users of Latest Updates
	- OMB Has Not Incorporated Social Media into Its Customer Outreach
	- Performance.gov Is Accessible on Mobile Devices, but OMB Has Not Yet Determined Whether to Pursue Mobile Applications
