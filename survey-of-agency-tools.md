# Survey of agency performance tools

_Non-authoritative performance.gov research, curated by 18F, a digital
consultancy in the US federal government._

Agencies use many different software packages for tracking and collecting
performance data. The tools listed here were included by 16 CFO agencies as part
of a [survey](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B2stDO5hLAHkZUxPYy04X3F3dk0)
for performance.gov.

We can't guarantee the accuracy of this page–it represents initial research
of team members, and could be incomplete or become out-of-date.


## Performance tools

### Budget Formulation and Execution Manager (BFEM)

Used by Treasury, NASA, DOE, DOI, and others. About [14 agencies in
total](https://www.tcg.com/our-work/treasury-budget-formulation-execution-manager-bfem-more-bang-for-your-buck/).

Created and [administered by the
Treasury](https://arc.publicdebt.treas.gov/financial_management_budget_formulation.htm).
Other agencies can pay a fee to use the system.

> The Administrative Resource Center (ARC) provides strategic planning, budget
> formulation, and performance management shared services to federal agencies
> and organizations using the BFEM application.

[BFEM](https://bfem.gov/bfem/login.seam?cid=33544) can be used for budget and
performance management. Focused on providing various reports for congress and
OMB. Can produce strategic planning documents with links to performance and
budget data.

Can export data in excel and other formats.


### Departmental E-Budgeting Suite (DEBS)

Used by DOL.

Homegrown internal-only system in use since 2007. Also sometimes referred to as
the Departmental E-Business Suite.

> The Departmental E-Budgeting System (DEBS) is an integrated budget environment
> that blends a set of COTS and GOTS solutions to optimize resources throughout the budget
> formulation lifecycle. The set of tools and techniques associated with DEBS
> permits users to track, spread, report and analyze budget and performance data
> within agencies and across DOL for greater transparency.

Seems to be focused on creating budget reports, less about data and data
visualizations or performance tracking.


### IBM Cognos

features.


### BFS

Used by EPA.

Private, homegrown, [internal-only tool](https://bfssb.epa.gov/Account/Login?ReturnUrl=%2f).

> The Budget Formulation System (BFS) is replacing EPA’s legacy Budget
> Automation System (BAS) system. It enables agency staff to formulate budgets,
> integrate budgets with strategic and annual performance plans, track financial
> actuals against established budgets, model future payroll needs, and more.

Can create pre-defined visualizations and reports. Some kind of
limited export is supported.

show that exporting individual reports and maybe raw data is possible.
